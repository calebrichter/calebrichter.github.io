I"“<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I am a graduate of the University of Michigan Computer Science. My passion is machine learning. I worked in a machine learning lab at Umich for three years. The lab taught me tons about deep learning, neural networks, data, and research. However, I need to know that I have a comprehensive foundation for continuing my pursuit of machine learning understanding. After a lot of looking about and comparing what free content was out there for this (there is a lot), I have decided on the <a href="d2l.ai">Dive into Deep Learning</a> interactive textbook. I learn best from working through problems, and I like the all text format.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Applications have traditionally been able to completely capture all of the internal logic. Machine learning fills the space of problems that cannot be simply captured in logic by <em>learning</em> from experience</p>

<p>There are a lot of different methods of optimizing parameters towards a goal which have been used on many different tasks from varying domains.</p>

<p><strong>Unsupervised</strong> learning takes unclassified input or data and tries to make sense of it- which can mean trying to classify it or to separate the signal from the noise and create it into something meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Supervised</strong> learning takes well structured input data such as labeled images and tries to build systems to classify, translate,  reccomend, or otherwise detect and classify the meaningful signal of the input data so that it can be used on a real world problem</p>

<p><strong>Reinforcement</strong> learning trains an agent acting in an environment â€“ rather than simply noticing or classifying patterns, it tries to create its observations of an environment into meaningful actions.</p>

<p>There have been many recent innovations enabled due to the large amounts of processing power now available.</p>
