I" <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I am a graduate of the University of Michigan Computer Science. My passion is machine learning. I worked in a machine learning lab at Umich for three years. The lab taught me tons about deep learning, neural networks, data, and research. However, I need to know that I have a comprehensive foundation for continuing my pursuit of machine learning understanding. After a lot of looking about and comparing what free content was out there for this (there is a lot), I have decided on the <a href="d2l.ai">Dive into Deep Learning</a> interactive textbook. I learn best from working through problems, and I like the all text format.</p>
