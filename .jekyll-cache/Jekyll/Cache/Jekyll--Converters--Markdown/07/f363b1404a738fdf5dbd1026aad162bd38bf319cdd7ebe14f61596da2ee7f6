<p>God put us here so that we could love each other and love Him.
We frequently love Him <strong>by</strong> loving each other.
He personally came to this earth and showed us what love is in the person of Jesus.
Along the way he revealed an enormous amount of other truths that he has communicated to us through His Word, the Bible.</p>
