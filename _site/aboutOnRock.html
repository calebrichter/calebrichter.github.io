    <h1>About OnRock</h1>
    <p>Knowing how to live out our faith is hard. God works through His Word to change our lives, but there have been many Monday mornings and weeks throughout my life that were completely unchanged by what I learned on Sunday morning.</p>
    <p>God has so many promises for those who are practicing their faith, and I want to help people know the goodness of letting God's love into more and more of our lives.</p>
    <p>One of the ways that I've loved to do this is through Bible study. My wife and I have hosted a Bible study at our house for a long time, and it's been an amazing way to connect with the body of Christ. Discussion is awesome around what a passage means in general and around what it means to us specifically, but when we near the end of our study and ask, "How can we live this out in our day-to-day lives?" there's often a lot of blank stares.</p>
    <p><strong>OnRock.net</strong> is a tool I've created that can help people connect the Word preached on Sundays to who we are as individuals with our unique roles, struggles, and goals. Based on your church's sermon for the week, it uses AI to generate two key items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A group Bible study</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Personal application ideas</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Group Bible studies are a great way to come together and study God's Word, but it's always challenging to know where to begin to apply and practice our faith. That's where personal application ideas come in. They help people begin to bridge the gap that often forms between "what we know" and "what we do."</p>
    <p>God has innumerable promises for us as we live our faith, and I long for people to experience His love manifestly throughout more and more of their days.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing... you are my friend if you do what I command."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do."
