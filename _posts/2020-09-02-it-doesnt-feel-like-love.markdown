# It Doesn't Feel Like Love

A Christian is called to love God and love his neighbor.
This essential calling stands at the base of our reality.
God showed us how to love in the life of Christ.

Christ performed and recommended actions which are unquestionably loving. 
In His life, He taught people life giving truths, fed the hungry, healed the sick, cast out demons, and ultimately gave up his life to defeat sin and death.
He commands us to do the same -- to care for the sick and the orphan, to feed the hungry, to teach and encourage people in the life giving truths that he brought. 
These actions are bursting with the beauty of love.

It is abundantly clear when we are volunteering at a soup kitchen or orphanage how we are following in Christ's footsteps.
It feels exactly right, perfectly aligned with what God wants us to do with our time and efforts.

but then we have to go back to work

back to the real world

Where for many of us, it seems like there just isn't opportunity to do what Jesus commands us to. 

I work in computer science. It is a very technical field, where we spend much of our time thinking about problems that are seemingly disconnected from purposeful love of humans. 
I spend large amounts of time trying to detangle miscommunications between computer programs.
I automate routine computer maintenence tasks that are so mundane it's hard to come up with a name for the scripts I'm writing. 


Recently, I have been studying machine learning, because I believe it will be hugely impactful in the future.
There is a lot of linear algebra, statistics, and calculus involved. 
When I'm diving into the complexities of neural networks, trying to develop a deep understanding and intuition for how they work, It feels like I'm just learning about a system of how numbers relate to each other.
There is no smiling face deep within the equation for backpropogation.
No contented man standing on the other side of stochastic gradient descent.
It feels like I'm learning about a system completely disconnected from any sort of loving actions.

__When I'm striving for deep technical excellence, it doesn't feel connected to the love that stands at the base of my reality.__

When numbers get large, it's much more challenging to connect to them. We don't understand what it means that 10 million people are using

Because people are really bad at thinking about big numbers, we tend to underestimate the scale on which technology impacts our world.





At work as a software engineer, it consistently seems to me like there is _no possible way_ that what I am doing is worth what they are paying me. But software engineers are paid what they are paid because they add that much value to the company. My company offers a variety of financial services to people. We recently passed the threshold of 100 billion dollars of deposits.
