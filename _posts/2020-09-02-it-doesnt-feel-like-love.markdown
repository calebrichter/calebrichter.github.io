A Christian is called to love God and love his neighbor.
This essential calling stands at the base of our reality.
God showed us how to love in the life of Christ.

Christ performed and recommended actions which are unquestionably loving. 
In His life, He taught people life giving truths, fed the hungry, healed the sick, cast out demons, and ultimately gave up his life to defeat sin and death.
He commands us to do the same -- to care for the sick and the orphan, to feed the hungry, to teach and encourage people in the life giving truths that he brought. 
These actions are bursting with the beauty of love.

It is abundantly clear when we are volunteering at a soup kitchen or orphanage how we are following in Christ's footsteps.
It feels exactly right, perfectly aligned with what God wants us to do with our time and efforts.

but then we have to go back to work

back to the real world

Where for many of us, it seems like there just isn't opportunity to do what Jesus commands us to. 

I work in computer science. It is a very technical field, where we spend much of our time thinking about problems that are seemingly disconnected from purposeful love of humans. 
I spend large amounts of time trying to detangle miscommunications between computer programs.
I automate routine computer maintenence tasks that are so mundane it's hard to come up with a name for the scripts I'm writing. 


Recently, I have been studying machine learning, because I believe it will be hugely impactful in the future.
There is a lot of linear algebra, statistics, and calculus involved. 
When I'm diving into the complexities of neural networks, trying to develop a deep understanding and intuition for how they work, It feels like I'm just learning about a system of how numbers relate to each other.
There is no smiling face deep within the equation for backpropogation.
No contented man standing on the other side of stochastic gradient descent.
It feels like I'm learning about a system completely disconnected from any sort of loving actions.

__When I'm striving for deep technical excellence, it doesn't feel connected to the love that stands at the base of my reality.__

# But it is


[Scope insensitivity](https://conceptually.org/concepts/scope-insensitivity) is a cognitive bias, where humans tend to have a really bad sense of how things grow multiplicatively. Adding another zero at the end of a large number doesn't make us actually feel like it's all that much bigger.


![xkcd on big numbers](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/million_billion_trillion.png)

Because people are really bad at thinking about big numbers, we tend to underestimate the scale on which technology impacts our world. We can't fathom the difference between something impacting 10 million people and 100 million people.

__What does this mean for a Christian who is trying to love people?__

"The love of God can make the smallest act of love sublime." Love can make me sharing a sandwich with my family an act of communion between eternal beings. If an eternal soul is brought an iota closer to God through our actions, that action has a beautiful and eternal value. 

Christians always live in the reality that our actions have far more meaning than they seem to. We are called to do all things as if they are for God. To work as if we are working for the Lord. To share sandwiches as if we are sharing them with Christ himself.

So for a Christian, scope insensitivity shouldn't be a foreign concept. Paul prays that the people in Ephesus "may have power, together with all the Lordâ€™s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ"

I pray that we, as Christians and as workers in various vocations, may see whatever work God calls us to as the immeasurably valuable work that it truly is. And I pray that we would be constantly inspired by God's immeasurable love for us.
