# Background
I am a graduate of the University of Michigan Computer Science. My passion is machine learning. I worked in a machine learning lab at Umich for three years. The lab taught me tons about deep learning, neural networks, data, and research. However, I need to know that I have a comprehensive foundation for continuing my pursuit of machine learning understanding. After a lot of looking about and comparing what free content was out there for this (there is a lot), I have decided on the [Dive into Deep Learning](d2l.ai) interactive textbook. I learn best from working through problems, and I like the all text format.

##Intro
    Applications have traditionally been able to completely capture all of the internal logic. Machine learning fills the space of problems that cannot be simply captured in logic by _learning_ from experience
