    <h1>About OnRock</h1>
    <p>Knowing how to live out our faith is hard. God works through His Word to change our lives, but there have been many Monday mornings and weeks throughout my life that were completely unchanged by what I learned on Sunday morning.</p>
    <p>God has so many promises for those who are practicing their faith, and I want to help people know the goodness of letting God's love into more and more of our lives.</p>
    <p>One of the ways that I've loved to do this is through Bible study. My wife and I have hosted a Bible study at our house for a long time, and it's been an amazing way to connect with the body of Christ. Discussion is awesome around what a passage means in general and around what it means to us specifically, but when we near the end of our study and ask, "How can we live this out in our day-to-day lives?" there's often a lot of blank stares.</p>
    <p><strong>OnRock.net</strong> is a tool I've created that can help people connect the Word preached on Sundays to who we are as individuals with our unique roles, struggles, and goals. Based on your church's sermon for the week, it uses AI to generate two key items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A group Bible study</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Personal application ideas</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Group Bible studies are a great way to come together and study God's Word, but it's always challenging to know where to begin to apply and practice our faith. That's where personal application ideas come in. They help people begin to bridge the gap that often forms between "what we know" and "what we do."</p>
    <p>God has innumerable promises for us as we live our faith, and I long for people to experience His love manifestly throughout more and more of their days.</p>
